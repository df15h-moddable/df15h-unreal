# Terms

My notes re: Funcom legal such as they are relvant to material in this repository.

## TLDR

What are the relevant documents?

- [Conan Exiles EULA](https://store.steampowered.com//eula/440900_eula_0) @ store.steampowered.
- `ConanExilesDevKit/CE_UnrealDevKit_EULA_Jan2017.docx`.
- [Unreal Engine EULA](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/unreal) @ unrealengine.

What did we learn ...?

- Both Funcom and Epic are extremely protective of their trademarks and particulalry logos. Do not use them.
- The Unreal Engine EULA (and by extension therefore the modkit EULA) is generous (within reasonable limits) of distributing technical information for learning purposes.
