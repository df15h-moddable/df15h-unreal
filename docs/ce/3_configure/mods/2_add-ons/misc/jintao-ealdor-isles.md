# Ealdor Isles

by Jintao.

- Eador Isles is a STAND-ALONE MAP, but ...
- It's also an add-on miscellanea (for any map). This is how we use it.

## Features

Aside from the map ...

- build kits (Ealdor Stone, Ealdor Wood, Ealdor Thatch, Ironborn, Medieval)
- prefabs
- decorations
- custom workbenches
- armors (e.g. Ealdor set)
- weapons
- saddles
- thralls and NPCs
