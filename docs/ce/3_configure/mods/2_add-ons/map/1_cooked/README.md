# Cooked

These mods are relatively fresh and likely fully functional.

- The term, "cooked" very specifically means that assets have been processed to agree with the latest Funcom build.
- For our purpose, we simply mean that the author is active and the mods are probably functional.
- For our purpose, an author is active if at least one of their mods was updated since last major Funcom release.
- A release won't necessarily break a mod, but diligent authors update with each release.
- The last major release by Funcom (at time of writing) was : "Age of Heroes", Oct 17 2024.
