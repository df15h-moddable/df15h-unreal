## Quirks

- Tot! Custom is feature-rich and well-implemented. Many would say it's an obvious upgrade on Fashionist, et al.
- ... but that's not necessarily true (rather, it's a choice), because ...
- Tot! customizations are _just_ skins that can _only_ be managed and applied via the TC UI (`shift + B`).
- Unlike the vanilla transmogrifications (Thaumaturgy Illusions).
- Unlike the item overlay slots in most games (as implemented for Conan Exiles by Fashionist).
- Not intuitive, because it doesn't behave like any other popular game. You have to learn to play TC's way.
- Consequence : When the player dies, and drops all gear, the TC appearance is not removed.
A workaround is to maintain a Nude profile. Switch to it and (per settings) TC won't let you switch back until you recover your gear.
- Consequence : TC mannequins don't have item slots. They are not containers. They are simply targets for TC profiles.
- Consequence : While there is a setting to require we own the gear we are customizing -- as long as a single set is in our inventory,
we can apply the profile to as many actors and mannequins as are in the vicinity.
