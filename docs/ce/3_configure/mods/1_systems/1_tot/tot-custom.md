# Tot! Custom

## Features

Customization is organized into four categories ...

- Bodies
- Weapons
- Armors
- Accessories

In each category, the facilities (sliders, colors, etc) are extensive.

In addition to the player character, customizations can be applied to ...

- thralls
- Tot! Admin "puppets" (cf. Pippi "thespians")
- two types of mannequin (stick+rope, carved)

And more ...

- Add accessories "regardless of original slot".
- Save profiles/presets.
- Supports high heels.

## Quirks

Tot! Custom is feature-rich and well-implemented, but ...
it DOES NOT behave like any typical RPG customization system!

- Tot! Custom is _unlike_ the item overlay slots in most games (as implemented for Conan Exiles by Testerle and Whiskey).
- Tot! Custom is _unlike_ the vanilla transmogrifications (Thaumaturgy Illusions).

Tot! Custom customizations are NAMED SKINS (aka profiles).

- We DO NOT morph our character's body -- rather, we make a separate named body profile (skin) and APPLY it.
- We do not transmogrify our weapons -- rather, we make a separate named weapons profile and APPLY it.
- We do not transmogrify our armor, nor do we slot overlay items into a paper doll -- rather, we make a separate named armor profile and APPLY it.
- We do not slot overlay accessories into a paper doll -- rather, we make a separate named accessories profile and APPLY it.
- To change our cusomization details on the fly, we don't unslot overlay items -- rather, we make separate named profiles and APPLY them.

This comes with some non-intuitive side-effects. Some could be called game-breaking, to various degrees.

- TC mannequins don't have item slots. They are not containers. They are simply targets for TC profiles.
- While there is a setting to require we own the gear we are customizing -- as long as a single set is in our inventory,
we can apply the profile to as many actors and mannequins as are in the vicinity.
- When the player dies, and drops all gear, the TC appearance is not removed.
Workaround: Maintain a Nude profile. Switch to it and (per settings) TC won't let you switch back until you recover your gear.
- TC's weapon customization system vastly complicates the otherwise simple feature of showing equipped gear -- sheathing it and unsheathing it.
The intended solution is that (1) we should disable the base game setting to show equipment, and (2) weapons are displayed as ACCESSORIES.
This very fiddly solution for all practical purposes doesn't scale beyond the player character -- not because we couldn't make a zillion profiles (we could, but that's _ridiculous_).
For that reason, we use the vanilla equipment display system rather than TC.

Q: Why so quirky?

A: A hint might lie in the doc : Accessories may be applied "regardless of original slot". The vanilla slot system might be a constraint the author wanted to work around.
