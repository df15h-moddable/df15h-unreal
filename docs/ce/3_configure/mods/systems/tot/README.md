# Tot!

The Tot! suite has been gradually updating and replacing the functionality of a number of older mods.

A few notes re: Tot!

- Tot! mods "are not supported" in single-player by the author. However, that doesn't seem to mean that they don't work.
- Tot! Admin is still labeled alpha (in 2025).
- In the meantime the other Tot! mods might work alongside Pippi.
