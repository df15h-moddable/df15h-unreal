The Tot! suite has been gradually updating and replacing the functionality of a number of older mods.

Use one set or the other ...

- Emberlight Improved Quality of Life (IQoL)
- JoshTech's Pippi
- Testerle's Fashionist
- Testerle's Unlock Plus
- Waffle's Chromatic Spice
- Whiskey's Accessory Wardrobe

... (old-school) OR (new-fangled) ...

- Tot! Sudo
- Tot! Admin
- Tot! Custom
- Tot! HUD
- tokatla's Thrall Wars Utilities (a plugin for Tot! Sudo; a remake of some Pippi features)

A few notes re: Tot!

- Tot! mods "are not supported" in single-player by the author. However, that doesn't seem to mean that they don't work.
- Tot! Admin is still labeled alpha (in 2025).
- In the meantime the other Tot! mods might work alongside Pippi.
