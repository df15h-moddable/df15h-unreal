## Features

In summary ...

- Capture Thralls and convert them to Conscripts.
- Build a Conscript Post.
- Assign up to three Conscripts to a Conscript Post.
- Feed Conscripts to gather materials.
- Upgrade Conscripts and Posts (Reaper to Warden to Stalker).

## Feats

- Unlock Conscription feats in the Survival section of Knowledge.
- The standard feat "Thrall Taker" is a pre-requisite.

## Contract of Conscription

First, we must convert a Thrall into a Conscript.

1. Place (build) a "Contract of Conscription" pedestal.
2. Capture a thrall.
3. Place the thrall in/at the pedestal.
4. At a Blacksmith's bench, craft a "Weapon/Tool Kit".
5. At an Armorer's bench, craft an "Armor Kit".
6. Place the kits into the pedestal.
7. Exit the pedestal, then select it again (hold) to open the standard radial menu.
8. In the radial menu, there is a new contextual "Sign Contract" selection.
9. Remove the converted thrall from the pedestal.

Notes:

- To make a Reaper, we require a "Light Armor Kit" and an "Iron Weapon/Tool Kit".
- To make a Warden, we require a "Medium Armor Kit" and an "Iron Weapon/Tool Kit".

Problems (in my experience) ...

- While the feats and kits appeared in the expected menus ...
- ... the stations (including the "Contract of Conscription" pedestal) did not.
- I had to Admin cheat the pedestal into my inventory to get started.

## Posts

- A "Post" is a Conscript's crafting station.
- Conscripts and Posts are tiered.
- A "Reaper" is the basic Conscript and Post.
- A "Warden" Post is created by upgrading a Reaper Post.
- A "Stalker" Post is created by upgrading a Warden Post.
- Each upgrade is crafted at the previous Post.

## Work

Conscript Posts require food as Fuel ...

- More than seventy standard food items are applicable, including ... 
- Grilled Steak, Roasted Haunch, Savory Cooked Fish, Exotic Cooked Fish.
