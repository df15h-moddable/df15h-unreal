# Mods

My notes for building and managing a playable modlist.

- Managing a playable modlist for Conan Exiles
is not nearly so well documented as for Skyrim (cf STEP).
- In fact, one could say it's not documented _at all_.
- Worse than that, most mods themselves are not documented _at all_.
- It's therefore essential to _take notes!_

These notes are oriented towards ...

- Solo mode (not a dedicated server).
- Multi-Map : Solo mode manages saves per map. This effectively allows us to run one character in Exiled Lands as we run another character on Siptah.
