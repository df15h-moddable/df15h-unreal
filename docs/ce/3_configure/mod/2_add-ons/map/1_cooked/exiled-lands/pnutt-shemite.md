# Shemite City State

by PNutt

- Adds a city (Iruk) to the western edge of the Exiled Lands, on the savannah north of Sepermeru.
- The city limits begin on the northern side of the vanilla location called the Crowngrove.

Conflicts ...

- The mod clobbers a few small camps and one white tiger location.
- There are four white tiger locations in the Exiled Lands -- two in or near the Iruk location.
- Only one of those two is clobbered by Iruk. The other one is untouched.
