# Shemite City State

by PNutt

- Adds a city (Iruk) to the western edge of the Exiled Lands, on the savannah north of Sepermeru.
- The city limits begin on the northern side of the vanilla location called the Crowngrove.
- There are no build-blockers. We're expected to enhance the city.
- The mod includes a sewer dungeon.

## Impressions

- The mod is _extremely_ well made. Feels like something out of a high-fidelity "Age of Conan".
- It contains well-chosen custom music. It sounds like it adds some from "Age of Conan", including the Tortage motif.

## Conflicts

- The mod seems genuinely designed to minimize impact.
- This mod does not require the Curse Wall to be disabled. It is within bounds.
- The Crowngrove does not seem substantially disrupted.
- The mod clobbers a few small camps and one white tiger location.
- There are four white tiger locations in the Exiled Lands -- two in or near the Iruk location.
- Only one of those two is clobbered by Iruk. The other one is untouched.

## Performance

- As one might expect from a mod this ambitious, it seems greedy with texture additions.
- We have experienced the low-res texture problem, as it pushes the limits of the allotted memory (which is less than our GPU has available).

## Build Kit

- The mod adds a build kit and decorations.
- The recipes must be discovered in the city of Iruk -- from a book.
- The kit may be accessed from Creative Mode w/o the book.
- The kit is available via the Construction Hammer.
