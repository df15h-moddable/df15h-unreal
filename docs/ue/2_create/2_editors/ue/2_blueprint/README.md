# Blueprint

"The Blueprint Visual Scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor. As with many common scripting languages, it is used to define object-oriented (OO) classes or objects in the engine." -- dev.epicgames

"Blueprints can get references to any asset in the game as well as any C++ exposed to blueprints." -- buckminsterfullerene02

## Blueprint Class

Explanation from "Conan Exiles Modder's Field Manual" (rephrased) ...

- A Blueprint Class is a template for an in-game object.
- At runtime the game engine creates one or more instances of the Class in the game world.
- These can be “living” objects that will behave according to their instructions.
- For example, `BP_NPC_Wildlife_Gazelle` is a Blueprint Class, and each gazelle you see in the game is an instance of that class.
