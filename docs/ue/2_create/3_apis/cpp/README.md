# C++

There are two ways to create and run C++ code for Unreal Engine mods ...

- Unreal Editor : Create a project in UE to bind directly to UE classes.
- UE4SS : Create a project to bind to the UE4SS API.

IMPORTANT : In BOTH cases, most of the authoring and compilation will happen _outside_ of the Unreal Editor.
The Unreal Editor doesn't actually include a build environment.
They expect us to point Microsoft Visual Studio to a shared filesystem.
