"The Blueprint Visual Scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor. As with many common scripting languages, it is used to define object-oriented (OO) classes or objects in the engine." -- dev.epicgames

"Blueprints can get references to any asset in the game as well as any C++ exposed to blueprints." -- buckminsterfullerene02
