# Create

## Concepts

IMPORTANT : Notes regarding key concepts can be found in the "editors" sub-section,
with the Unreal Engine dev kit / IDE.
This is because the dev kit most comprehensively expresses the core concepts,
and to avoid duplication of the same material in any more general place.

## Editors

The official Unreal Editor is the most common way to edit Unreal projects.
There are two kinds of distribution of the Unreal Editor we are likely to use.

- UE
- modkit

## APIs

### C++

There are two ways to create and run C++ code for Unreal Engine mods ...

- Unreal Editor : Create a project in UE to bind directly to UE classes.
- UE4SS : Create a project to bind to the UE4SS API.
